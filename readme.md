Playing around with garminconnect to create custom challenges, using the **"movingDuration"** variable to count active minutes.
Optionally **Training load** or **other variables** can be used for other ranking or other activity type.

Prerequisites: python3, pip installed:
```console
pip install garminconnect
python3 strength_v2.py 2024-11-17
```
strength_v2 will display the total active minutes spent on strength training since the supplied date.
